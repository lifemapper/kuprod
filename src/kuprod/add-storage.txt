# 2. add nas interface for VLAN=2 used for notyeti-190 clsuter
# the interface em1 is the private interface, and ".2" has to correspond to the VLAN ID.
/opt/rocks/bin/rocks add host interface nas-0-0 em1.2
/opt/rocks/bin/rocks set host interface ip nas-0-0 em1.2 192.168.190.2
/opt/rocks/bin/rocks set host interface name nas-0-0 em1.2 nas-0-0
/opt/rocks/bin/rocks set host interface subnet nas-0-0 em1.2 storage-190
/opt/rocks/bin/rocks set host interface vlan nas-0-0 em1.2 2
